# CNN for device-free localization

This script contains a minimal implementation (based on Tensorflow) of a CNN that can be used for device-free localization. Some additional packages apart from Tensorflow are needed; you can find them at the beginning of the script.

The sample data files "clean_32pos.mat" and "positions32.mat" mentioned in the script are not included in this repository because they are very large, but they can be downloaded using the following links:

- [clean_32pos.mat](http://netweb.ing.unibs.it/ntw/tools/csimurder/clean_32pos.mat)
- [positions32.mat](http://netweb.ing.unibs.it/ntw/tools/csimurder/positions32.mat)

The original implementation of the CNN, based on PyTorch, can be found [at this repository](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/csicloak) (**WARNING:** repository very large!)
